# LOCA!
map of movies and dramas

LOCA! is a data visualization of film and TV series, particularly a map of filming locations in Hong Kong SAR. Recently, Hong Kong's tourism and related industries have been struggling economically; the government has been trying to promote local culture and enhance the attractiveness through mega-events and investments. LOCA!" aims to be a complementary strategy to sustainably attract tourists and local citizens to visit Hong Kong in the form of photography and cultural explorations.

「LOCA！」是一个电影和电视剧的数据可视化设计与交互平台，特别关注香港的拍摄地点深度游地图的构建。近来，香港旅游业及相关产业的经济和发展面临巨大挑战，政府一直在努力通过大型活动和投资来推广香港。「LOCA！」希望作为数据＋文旅的补充策略，以实地摄影和文化探索的可持续方式，吸引游客和本地市民游览香港，刺激相关地点的人流与经济。
